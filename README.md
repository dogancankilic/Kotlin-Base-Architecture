This repository consists of 3 layers(data-domain-ui) and practices railway oriented programming with Kotlin  [Result](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-result/ "Result").

### What is Railway Oriented Programming
Railway oriented programming ensures us to track happy and unhappy path with functional programming technique. In this repo every api call has a Result of Success or Failure path.

### Note
In Kotlin 1.3 till 1.5 this Result could not be used directly as a return type of Kotlin functions. This restriction was lifted in Kotlin 1.5 according to [documentation](http://https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/master/proposals/stdlib/result.md#limitations "documentation")
